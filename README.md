## Archival
This script has been moved into archival as there is no longer any need to modify it. Please only utilize this script to test against your own account(s) or any account(s) you have permission to pentest.

## Purpose
The purpose of this script was to brute-force guess the passwords to Instagram accounts. This script was written for educational purposes only and I don't suggest you actually use this utility on any accounts other than your own. I'm not responsible for any misuse of this script.

## Specifics:
- Comes with 2 separate modes including a combination approach where you may know a username and not the password, as well as a random guessing approach for both usernames and passwords.
- The option to use a proxy is included. Update proxy.txt with your proxy details.
- The combination option will require adding in a combination file with any of the username details you may already know.
- This will return whether an account is already banned or not.
- This can be run from any Python-enabled device and against any device that can use Instagram including mobile.
